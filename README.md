=======================================================================================================
=======================================================================================================
The workflow for this repo is as follows:

A new master branch for each new project will be created with the followiing naming convention:
projectName-MASTER

For each master branch follow this workflow:

1. create a development branch from the project master branch where all developmant will be tracked
3. create a release branch from the development branch where all changes will be confirmed before publishing to master
4. create a feature branch for each new feature
5. when a feature is complete it is merged to the develop branch
6. the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master
7. the feature branch is closed(deleted)
